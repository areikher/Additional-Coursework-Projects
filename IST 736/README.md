IST 736 is Texting Mining. This final project required me to pick a topic and create models based on the dataset I choose.

For my project, I chose to compare an original work to the adapted work. The work I chose was that of Alexander Hamiton and Hamilton The Musical.
My motivation for picking this topic was 3 fold. 1. I knew that Alexander Hamilton was a notorious writer so there would be plenty of different writing
samples for me to pick to analyize. 2. I really like the musical Hamilton. 3. In many of my classes, we worked with the Federalist Papers dataset where 
we attempt to predict who wrote the essays with unknown authorship. When working with this dataset, it made me want to explore the musical lyrics and 
compare them to Alexander's actual work.

In this folder, you will find:
1. Python code with the models
2. Final Project Report Doc
3. Final Presentation slide deck
