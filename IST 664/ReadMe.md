This folder is for IST 664. This is Natural Language Processing.

In this folder, you will find the files for the final course project. This project required us to pick a topic and run various NLP tasks to answer our
target question. The topic we chose was comparing a banned book to a non-banned book by the same author. The goal was to determine why one book was banned while the other was not. The books selected was John Green's books Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars. Both books are aimed at young adult readers but Looking for Alaska is one of the most banned books of all time.

We used a variety of different methods to analyize the data. The main method was using a function called profanity checker to determine how much of each text was considered profanity. From there, we did a variety of different analysis to determine which one had more profanity.
